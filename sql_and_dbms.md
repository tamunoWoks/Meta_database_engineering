## SQL
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard programming language used to communicate with and manipulate relational databases. You use SQL to:
- Ask questions about the data (queries).
- Add new data.
- Update existing data.
- Delete data.
- Create and modify the structure of the database itself (tables, views, etc.).  

It is the fundamental tool for anyone working with data, from analysts and developers to data scientists and administrators.

### SQL Dialects:
A "dialect" is a variant of SQL that is specific to a particular database management system (DBMS). While all SQL dialects are based on the same core standard (ANSI SQL), each vendor adds its own unique features, functions, and slight syntactic variations. The major dialects include:
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- MySQL

**The important thing to remember:** Core SQL commands like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE work almost identically across all dialects. The differences become more apparent with advanced functions, date manipulation, and procedural code.
