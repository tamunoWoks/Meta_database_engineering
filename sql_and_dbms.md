## SQL
**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard programming language used to communicate with and manipulate relational databases. You use SQL to:
- Ask questions about the data (queries).
- Add new data.
- Update existing data.
- Delete data.
- Create and modify the structure of the database itself (tables, views, etc.).  

It is the fundamental tool for anyone working with data, from analysts and developers to data scientists and administrators.
