### Data:
At its core, data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details. These facts can be anything—numbers, words, observations, measurements, symbols, or even just descriptions of things.  

Think of it as the basic building blocks of information. By itself, a single piece of data might not mean much. It needs to be processed, organized, and structured to become useful.

Data is stored systematically, and these are the characteristics of systematic data:
- Identifiable features or attributes.
- Stored in entities eg. Tables

### Types of Databases:
1. **Object Oriented Databases:** Data stored in form of objects.
