### Database
A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is organized and held systematically to make it more manageable, efficient and secure.

### Database tasks:
- Store data
- Form data relationships
- Filter data
- Search data
- Perform CRUD operations

### Data:
At its core, data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details. These facts can be anythingâ€”numbers, words, observations, measurements, symbols, or even just descriptions of things.  

Think of it as the basic building blocks of information. By itself, a single piece of data might not mean much. It needs to be processed, organized, and structured to become useful.

Data is stored systematically, and these are the characteristics of systematic data:
- Identifiable features or attributes.
- Stored in entities eg. Tables

### Types of Databases:
1. **Object-Oriented Databases:** Data stored in form of objects.
2. **Graph Databases:** Data stored in form of nodes.
